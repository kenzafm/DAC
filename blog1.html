        <br><br>Donald Trump winning the 2016 election marked a significant point in history, causing many riots, 
        conflicts and controversy since Trump became the 45th president of the United States. In 2018, Britanny Kaiser, 
        a former employee of Cambridge Analytica came forward as a whistleblower regarding their unethical data practices. 
        Kaiser insinuated that the 2016 Trump election and Brexit were influenced immensely by the company.<br> 

        <br>Trump’s campaign director hired Cambridge Analytica to drive more votes. Cambridge Analytica was solely created 
        to collect and use your own personal data against you. Political parties all over the world such as Lithuania, 
        Trinidad and Tobago, Kenya, Malaysia, etc. hire Cambridge Analytica to tailor advertisements in their political/party’s favor. 
        Trump’s campaign launched Project Alamo and spent $1 Million USD per day solely on facebook ads.<br>

        <br>Analytica would collect behavioral analysis via users’ clicks and cookies and categorize a type of user that can be 
        persuaded to vote for their political party of choice. Cambridge Analytica called these users the “Persuadables”, from 
        there, they would create personalized ads based on their personality to persuade them in their favor. They had 5000 data 
        points on every American voter, with these points they could predict exact user behavior.<br> 

        <br>Analytica confirmed it could predict the personality of every single American who had facebook. Based on personalities 
        of the easily convinced, Analytica created targeted content to drive specific behavior based on their data training models. 
        Trump 2016’s digital campaign director claimed to have run 5.9 million visual ads on Facebook, in contrast to Hillary Clinton’s 
        66 thousand.<br> 

        <br>Most, if not all the data CA used, came from Facebook, American votes were being controlled by these media companies. 
        Trump’s campaign knew the company they hired was playing the entire psychology of an entire nation without their consent 
        nor awareness. Cambridge Analytica were consistently cheating the democratic process as a full-service propaganda machine. 
        This company manipulated millions of Americans to see the world how they wanted to.<br>
