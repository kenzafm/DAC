    <div class="blog-title">What your Terms and Conditions<br>are secretly hiding from you by design</div>

        <br><br>Terms and conditions are lengthy, wordy and nearly impossible to finish reading. These preliminary texts are a way 
        for companies to do their due diligence by transferring all the liability from them to you. These terms are manipulated by 
        design, companies write these conditions knowing that the user won’t read pages full of legal jargon and wordy language. 
        Companies count on this human behavior and intentionally hide certain/specific information. Chances are you’re agreeing to 
        something you likely don’t understand fully, and that’s unfortunately by design.<br> 

        <br>These texts are written to discourage you from reading them. Research studies show that these policies purposefully use 
        vague or complex language, so users can find it challenging on exactly what they are agreeing to. A particular study 
        demonstrates that numerous agreements contain ambiguous terms that prevent users from comprehending them.<br> 

        <br>When you click “I agree”, you unknowingly consent for companies to sell and use your personal information however they 
        would like to. It’s not entirely clear if the lawyers of these companies are trying to be comical or humorous. For instance, 
        Apple iTunes makes you agree not to use their software in order “to develop nuclear weapons” when you accept their agreement. 
        Even Amazon includes a part recusing itself from responsibility in the chance of a zombie apocalypse.<br>

	    <br>What these agreements hope you miss, is that you are often giving up your common legal rights. It almost entirely removes your 
        ability to sue in order to prevent any legal action. For example, AT&T's terms have you agreeing with waiving your right to a 
        jury trial or to participate in any class action lawsuits. Research shows that 97% of participants have agreed to absurd clauses, 
        such as sharing all their data, all because they didn’t choose to read the agreements.<br> 
        
        <br>What most do not know, is that most companies include a section allowing them to change the terms without warning or needing 
        to notify you. Therefore when simply agreeing to the terms and conditions only once, they can continuously change those terms 
        without letting you know what they have changed. Some platforms will take all user content as intellectual property. In 
        particular, Twitter’s terms say that any posted user content grants the company worldwide to “use, process, copy, publish, 
        reproduce, display, adapt, modify and distribute” any and all media content posted by any user.<br>

        <br>The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) discovered that a lot of websites make it hard for users to choose not to sell 
        their personal data. Some reports even say there are little to non-existent options in opting out of accepting these terms. 
        Therefore, users are left with taking the risk of being in the dark on what they are agreeing to, all in the reward to 
        partake in a simple yet deceiving software.
