    <div class="blog-title">Data Privacy Just Became A Lot <br> More Complicated</div>

        <br><br>The attempt to secure one's privacy online was always a difficult task. Information 
        shared online becomes free use to governments, advertisers, and employers. The control of your 
        privacy may already seem out of reach in current circumstances, but with the introduction of 
        artificial intelligence (AI), data privacy may have just gotten even more exploitative than it already is.<br>

        <br>AI systems pose many threats to our data privacy. The difference between internet commercialization and AI 
        is the vast scale that AI is able to operate in. AI algorithms carry a ginormous capacity to capture data, 
        which makes it difficult for even the humans who created the algorithms to keep track and limit the AI. 
        Additionally, algorithms trained to gather data from the internet can harness personal and sensitive 
        information about people or their relationships with their family, work, and others. This algorithmic 
        practice in particular contributes to spear-phishing, which is the targeting of data in order to commit 
        identity theft or fraud.<br>

        <br>Organizations have started integrating AI into their hiring processes with a few surprising consequences, 
        Amazon’s own AI hiring screening tool was found to be biased against female candidates. Additionally, 
        AI facial recognition has attempted to be used to identify suspects of crimes, which may seem like a 
        good idea until the algorithms consistently compute numerous false arrests of black men.<br>

        <br>The problem with creating legislation to protect against data privacy is the interpretation in 
        determining whether a firm has collected too much data. It seems as though technology is moving 
        faster than we are able to understand it. This all leads to the question of what we, the users, 
        can do to protect our privacy.<br>

        <br>Honestly, probably not that much. Perhaps we should all just surrender to the robots. 
        But, if you still have a little bit of optimism, we can agree that the default for data collection 
        should be a clear agreement of consent in order to have your data accessed and shared. There are 
        solutions being made such as Apple’s App Tracking Transparency, launched in 2021, the app asks 
        users if they want to allow the app to track them across other apps and websites. Marketing 
        industry reports estimate that 80% to 90% of people presented with that choice say no. 
        Another built-in opt-out signal is the Global Privacy Control, that prevents the placement 
        of cookies by third parties or the sale of individuals’ data without the need to check a box. 
        The California Privacy Protection Act currently provides that browsers may include this capability, 
        but it has not been mandatory. Legislative measures need to be taken in order to protect all our data and privacy.
